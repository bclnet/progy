# Names & Circles

One of the hardest craftsmanships of programing is something that may at first may seem quite simple: choosing names and drawing circles around things.

## Naming

Names establish symbols and start to make a vauge idea concreate.
good names are understandable by you a month later, or by another developer using your code.

### Point of view
SendFile are you sending the file to the server, or is the server sending the file to you?

### Breaking change
Changing names becomes a `breaking change`
Refactoring tools allow names to change, however once your code is in the wild, anyone using your code will have to make the same changes.

## Drawing Circles

Names create symbols, these symbols are then grouped into structures.

The resuls of the grouping really do matter. At one point in time there maybe the same about of symbols and how they are grouped my not seem to matter. However you are defining how concepts are grouped, and evolve together overtime. Forecasting into the future how will these groupsing change?
