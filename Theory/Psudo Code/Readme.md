# Psudo Code

Psudo code is a standard-less language never processed by a computers.

The whole language is completly madeup by anyone on the fly, and more of a pattern for composing your thoughts.

For example finding an item in a list:

maybe starts with something simple
```
list = {}
loop list
   if found item
      return it
```

then turns into more of a function
```
foo(item) {
    list = getlist()
    while (list.notend) {
        if (list.item == item)
         return item;
    }
}
```
The whole langage is notes for humans only, meaning it can be very loose, and does not even need to be logical.

```
while (looking in the list) {
    find item in the database and add to my collection
}
```
