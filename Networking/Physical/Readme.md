# Networking

QAM is the predominate wifi/cellphone transmition
Ethernet is the predominate networking transmition

## Transmission Media

* Telegraph (morse-code)
* Radio
* Fiber (Single-Mode, Multi-Mode)
* Shielded
* Twisted Pair
* Coaxial
* Carrier Wave

## Multiplexing, Modulating

* Manual Multiplexing
  When u need more than one consumer using a single resource.
  Manual switch, switch to the consumer who can use it.

* Time Division Multiplexing
  Time based, each consumer gets 5 seconds.

* Amplitude Modulating
  AM modulate based on amplitude

* Frequence Modulating
  FM modulate based on frequency


## QAM
Lookup qam

## Token Ring
Token ring is like roll call there is a token that goes around in a circle and only when a consumer has the token may they use the shared resource.

## Ethernet
Ethernet or CDMA/CD is like natural conversation. Listen if nobody is talking then talk, if two talk at same time, both stop talking and try again at a random interval.

Like natural conversation, to many people talking in close proximity and u get a buzz. Also unlike it's natural analogy. Everyone talks in the same tone and speed. Making it impossible to identify separate conversations.

## Ethernet Physical
MAC address
CDMA/CD
Frequency modulation over a send pair and receive pair of wires.
