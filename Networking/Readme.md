# Networking
Networking has to do with sharing a constrained resource.

As it relates to humans this resource could be considered sounds we make. When multiple people need to communicate in a constrained space we have produced various processes to achieve this. 
* `roll call` - a cordinator names each person in the room and they each have a chance to speak.
* `conch shell`, `baton`, `token ring` - token passed around, if you hold the token you have a chance to speak.
* `small group`, `natural conversation`, `csma/cd` - talk when no body is talking, if two people try to talk at same time then stop and wait for an opening.
