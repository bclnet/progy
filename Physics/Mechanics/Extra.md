## [Integrated circuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit)

- Transistor - Cow grade example
  - if one or two cows would lay down on grate. All the other cows could cross
  - variable flow. when grate is four cows wide. if whole gate is covered then all the cows move. If only half covered then half move
  - cows represents electrons. electrons like water drain. So new analogy
-  if these cows where trying to cross a piraña filled stream at a gate that was three cows wide. Continue to sacrifice one to three cows and they can cross at respective percentages. But stop sacrificing cows and the flow stops
- emitter (new field), collector (cows), base (grate)
- there are holes in the gate that drain. continue sprinkling electrons to cover the holes and the electrons at the collector can cross to the emitter at respective percentages
- allows a variable current to flow from collector to emitter based on percentage of gate coverage
- uses NPN or PNP
- Diode - NP example
- electrons repel other electrons. with a diode the source electrons can cover the holes if current is flowing in one direction. And repel the electrons in the hole, cause a wider gap if the electrons flow in the opposite direction
  - makes a one way valve. Unless too much pressure then gate jumps anyways


*Example*
```
Sound can be produced by a speaker with a push-pull force on a paper cone connected to an electonic circut with an electro-magnet.

A bridge rectifier (four diodes) splits the electronic signal into two paths, one for push and one for pull.

Each path is connected to the gate of a transistors creating a push pull amplifier.

A large voltage is placed at both collectors of the transistors. Inputs at each gate and both emitters connected. outputs original sound wave as a larger but scaled version of the original. amplified;

## DATA

Encoded on measurable attributes

With fiber:

- lights off or on
- its frequency
- its intensity
- its polarity
- or combination of each compounding the data transfer rate.

It can all be normalized to the digital states of 0 and 1.
