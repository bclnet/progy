Static ram. is the fastest but costliest storage. There's a way I can put two logic gates that feed their outputs to each other, so that they store a bit value on or off.  I can arrange these in huge fields with rows and columns like crops, and store large amounts of bits.

## Dram
Dynamic ram. A much smaller storage mechanism, and easier to reproduce. Allowing 1000s of times increase in storage capacity. Vast fields of draining wells. With a refresh process to check how empty and refill if partially filled. Also arranged in huge fields  with rows and columns like crops, allowing the storage of vast quantities of bits. 

## Ddram
Also called DDR or double dynamic ram. Uses the same technique as Dram but allows two reads and writes per access. The data wires to the memory chips have become the bottleneck. So DDR uses a half rise and half fall to double the bandwidth though the memory terminals. Everything else inside the package is similar to Dram.

## Nvram
Also called non volatile ram. Uses a floating charge inside the silicon to hold a value. Setting or clearing the charge as needed. Holds its value even when power has been removed.

## Platters
Spinning platters and a read/write head slide to magnetic islands on the platters changing the magnetism of that island to store a one or zero. Also holds its values when power has been removed.
