# Fabrication

## Screen printing for t-shirts

Screen printing is the more well-known and common method of custom t-shirt printing. This process involves separating out each color in a design and then burning them to individual fine-mesh screens. Ink is then pushed through those screens with a squeegee down onto the shirt. This is a lengthy process however, huge efficiencies at higher quantities makes this the perfect option for bulk fabrication of large custom apparel runs at the best cost savings option.


## Lithography

Lithography is used in the production of electrical components. In computing, lithography is the process of imprinting patterns onto semiconductors to use in circuits. Photolithography is used to transfer a pattern from a photomask to the surface of a substrate.

We are able to create complex structures using a multi-step process similar to screen printing.


## IC Production

- Semi-conductor means add or subtract to change it.
- Silicon because its semi-conductor
- Silicon rod process
- Sanding/polish
- Screen print
  - use photo-resist and light
  - bulk can get changed to N or P
  - bake for oxide or coat w metal
  - acid etch
  - rinse to clean
  - repeat
- Because flat like the interstates, if two wires need to cross they have to take a bridge, go up a layer and back down
- Modern have like 40 metal layers

## Continual Advancement
The materials, techiques and technologies used in fabrication are continually advancing as we find newer and better approaches.

Some of these advances:
- Binning
- Multi-patterning
- Immersion (water)
- Self-assembly
- larger wafers (300mm)
- EUV
- Chiplets
- Silicon-vias
- Interposer, Bridges
