## IC PRODUCTION

- Semi-conductor means add or subtract to change it.
- Silicon because its semi-conductor
- Silicon rod process
- Sanding/polish
- Screen print
  - use photo-resist and light
  - bulk can get changed to N or P
  - bake for oxide or coat w metal
  - acid etch
  - rinse to clean
  - repeat
- Because flat like the interstates, if two wires need to cross they have to take a bridge, go up a layer and back down
- Modern have like 40 metal layers
